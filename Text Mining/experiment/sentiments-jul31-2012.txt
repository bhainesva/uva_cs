Simple Rules for Monetary Policy
A staff presentation summarized research on the efficacy of alternative simple monetary policy rules in fostering the Federal Reserve's monetary policy objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
Negative	The presentation reviewed the characteristics of a variety of rules and noted a number of reasons why current conditions might warrant deviating from the prescriptions of simple rules designed for more normal times.
Negative	The presentation also discussed how simple rules might be used as part of a comprehensive policy framework to provide clear and transparent benchmarks for monetary policy decisionmaking and the possibility that such rules could be helpful in communicating the connection between policy choices and the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) objectives.
Neutral	Meeting participants expressed a range of views regarding the appropriate role of policy rules in monetary policy decisionmaking.
Neutral	A number of participants indicated that such rules have played a useful role in informing the Committee's monetary policy deliberations.
Neutral	However, several participants pointed to specific considerations--including the possible mismeasurement of unobservable variables, such as potential output, and uncertainty about the appropriate economic models to use in estimating the magnitude of those variables--that might limit the usefulness of simple rules both internally and in public communications.
Neutral	Several participants saw value in examining the performance of rules across a range of economic models.
Negative	Participants discussed the case for making adjustments to the prescriptions of simple policy rules in the current circumstances to take into account various considerations such as the effective lower bound for the federal funds rate, the effects of the Committee's balance sheet policies, and potential shifts in the dynamics of the economy.
Negative	Some participants noted that adjustment of standard policy rules for balance sheet policies would tend to push up the federal funds rate prescription, while a number of participants indicated that other factors related to current circumstances may warrant maintaining an accommodative stance of policy for longer than would be prescribed by standard rules.
Negative	With regard to the latter, some participants suggested that inertial policy rules--that is, rules under which any movements in the stance of policy tend to be fairly persistent--would be most appropriate in the current context.
Negative	Developments in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet
The Manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets during the period since the FOMC met on June 19-20, 2012.
Negative	He also reported on System open market operations, including the ongoing reinvestment into agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) of principal payments received on SOMA holdings of agency debt and agency-guaranteed MBS as well as the operations related to the continuation of the maturity extension program authorized at the June 19-20, 2012, FOMC meeting.
Negative	His report included a summary of analysis prepared by the staff on the potential implications of the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's securities portfolio for private- sector holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS and for trading conditions in markets related to these securities.
Negative	The Manager also reported on recent developments in European money markets and implications for the yields on the euro-denominated assets that the Federal Reserve holds in its foreign exchange reserves.
Negative	By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.
Negative	There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account over the intermeeting period.
Negative	Staff Review of the Economic Situation
The information reviewed at the July 31-August 1 meeting indicated that economic activity increased at a slower pace in the second quarter than earlier in the year and that labor market conditions had improved little in recent months.
Negative	In addition, revised data for 2009 through 2011 from the Bureau of Economic Analysis indicated that the recession had been slightly less deep and the early part of the subsequent recovery had been a bit more gradual than previously thought, leaving the level of real gross domestic product (GDP) at the end of last year essentially the same as estimated earlier.
Negative	In the second quarter, consumer price inflation was markedly lower than in the first quarter, mostly reflecting substantial declines in consumer energy prices, while measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable.
Positive	Private nonfarm employment expanded in June at about the same modest pace as in the second quarter as a whole, and government employment decreased slightly.
Negative	The unemployment rate was 8.2 percent in June, the same as its average during the first half of the year.
Positive	The rate of long-duration unemployment stayed elevated, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons was still high.
Negative	Indicators of job openings and firms' hiring plans were generally subdued.
Negative	While initial claims for unemployment insurance trended down a bit over the intermeeting period, they remained at a level consistent with continued modest increases in employment in the coming months.
Negative	Manufacturing production decelerated significantly in the second quarter following a large gain in the first quarter, while the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization was unchanged on balance.
Negative	The production of motor vehicles and parts increased considerably last quarter, but factory output outside of the motor vehicle sector was essentially flat.
Negative	Automakers' schedules indicated that the pace of motor vehicle assemblies in the third quarter would be about the same as in the second quarter.
Negative	Broader indicators of manufacturing output, such as the diffusion indexes of new orders from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, declined in recent months and were at levels consistent with only muted increases in production in the near term.
Negative	Real personal consumption expenditures increased at a slower rate in the second quarter than in the first quarter, primarily reflecting a decrease in spending for motor vehicles.
Negative	Meanwhile, real disposable personal income rose at a faster pace than consumer spending in both the first and second quarters, boosted in part in recent months by lower energy prices.
Negative	Consumer sentiment as measured by the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers (Michigan Survey) was more downbeat in June and July than earlier in the year.
Neutral	Conditions in the housing market generally improved further in recent months, but activity remained at a low level against the backdrop of the large inventory of foreclosed and distressed properties and tight underwriting standards for mortgage loans.
Positive	Both starts and permits of new single-family homes increased in the second quarter.
Positive	Starts of new multifamily units were about the same last quarter as in the previous quarter, but permits rose, which pointed to higher multifamily construction in the coming months.
Neutral	Home prices increased in May for the fifth consecutive month.
Negative	Sales of new homes in the second quarter were moderately higher than in the first quarter, but existing home sales decreased slightly.
Negative	Real business expenditures on equipment and software rose in the second quarter at a faster pace than in the first quarter.
Neutral	However, new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft decreased last quarter, and the backlog of unfilled orders decelerated sharply.
Negative	Other recent forward-looking indicators, such as surveys of business conditions and capital spending plans, also suggested that increases in outlays for business equipment would slow in coming months.
Negative	Real business spending for nonresidential construction increased somewhat in the second quarter but remained at a relatively low level.
Negative	Meanwhile, business inventories generally appeared to be relatively well aligned with sales.
Negative	Real federal government purchases decreased a little in the second quarter, following a much sharper decline in the previous three quarters, as the continued contraction in defense spending eased.
Negative	Real state and local government purchases continued to contract at a moderate rate last quarter.
Negative	The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in May, as exports edged up and imports declined.
Positive	The increase in exports primarily reflected higher exports of services and agricultural products.
Negative	The decrease in imports was the result of a decline in oil imports, as both the price and the quantity of oil imports fell.
Neutral	Imports of consumer goods and industrial supplies also moved down, but imports of capital goods and automotive products increased.
Negative	Based on an estimate of the trade data for June, the advance release of the national income and product accounts showed that real net exports of goods and services made a small negative arithmetic contribution to the increase in U.S. real GDP in the second quarter.
Negative	Overall U.S. consumer prices increased at a slower pace in the second quarter than in the first.
Very negative	Consumer energy prices declined significantly last quarter, and survey data indicated that gasoline prices fell somewhat further in the first few weeks of July.
Very negative	Meanwhile, consumer food prices posted only a small increase last quarter, but the recent sizable run-up in spot and futures prices of farm commodities, reflecting the effects of the drought and hot weather in the midwestern part of the United States, pointed to some temporary upward pressures on retail food prices later this year.
Negative	Consumer prices excluding food and energy increased more moderately in the second quarter than in the first.
Negative	Near-term inflation expectations from the Michigan Survey rose a little in June and July, while longer-term inflation expectations in the survey continued to be stable.
Negative	Available measures of labor compensation indicated that nominal wage gains remained restrained.
Positive	The employment cost index rose at a modest pace again in the second quarter.
Negative	Average hourly earnings for all employees also increased at a relatively slow rate last quarter.
Negative	Foreign economic growth continued to be subdued, as fiscal retrenchment and financial stresses in the euro area continued to weigh on economic activity in Europe and elsewhere.
Negative	Recent indicators of production and confidence in the euro area remained weak, and the preliminary second-quarter estimate of real GDP in the United Kingdom showed a contraction.
Negative	Real GDP in China accelerated somewhat in the second quarter following a relatively weak expansion in the first quarter, and recent monthly data suggested some further improvement.
Neutral	However, data for other emerging market economies generally pointed to a deceleration in economic activity last quarter.
Negative	Foreign inflation eased in the second quarter and remains well contained, as earlier declines in the prices of energy and other commodities passed through to the retail level.
Negative	Staff Review of the Financial Situation
Several factors influenced developments in financial markets since the time of the June FOMC meeting.
Negative	Generally weaker-than-expected economic data in the United States, concerns about the fiscal and banking situation in the euro area, and the outlook for global economic growth weighed on investor sentiment.
Neutral	However, the effects of these factors were offset to some extent by actual and expected easing of monetary policy in the United States and abroad and by better-than-anticipated profits at some S&P 500 firms.
Positive	Interest rates generally moved down, on net, over the intermeeting period.
Negative	The yield on nominal 10-year Treasury securities declined to a historically low level, partly due to a lower expected path of the federal funds rate, the continuation of the maturity extension program announced at the June FOMC meeting, and perceptions of an increased likelihood that the Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy further.
Negative	In addition, persistent concerns about euro-area developments were reportedly associated with increased safe-haven demands that contributed to the decline in Treasury yields.
Negative	Anecdotal reports suggested that the decrease in shorter-term yields may also have reflected somewhat increased expectations that the Federal Reserve would reduce the interest rate paid on reserve balances in coming months.
Very negative	Near-term indicators of inflation expectations derived from nominal and inflation-protected Treasury securities fell modestly despite an increase in some commodity prices; such indicators changed little at longer horizons.
Negative	The expected path for the federal funds rate derived from money market futures quotes shifted down.
Negative	Conditions in short-term unsecured dollar funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period, although most peripheral euro-area institutions continued to have little, if any, access to such markets.
Negative	In secured funding markets, Treasury general collateral repurchase agreement rates rose slightly on balance.
Negative	Broad indexes of U.S. equity prices rose somewhat, on net, over the intermeeting period, with significant gains prompted in part by comments from European officials that apparently raised investor expectations for near-term European policy actions.
Negative	Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index rose slightly.
Negative	Stock prices for the large domestic bank holding companies posted mixed changes over the period, and credit default swap (CDS) spreads for those firms generally moved lower on net.
Negative	Yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds fell further over the intermeeting period, approaching record lows.
Negative	Their spreads relative to comparable-maturity Treasury securities narrowed but were still above their average levels prior to the financial crisis.
Negative	Nonfinancial firms continued to issue debt at a strong pace over the period.
Positive	Gross investment-grade corporate bond issuance remained robust in June and July, while the volume of nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding rose early in the second quarter but decreased slightly in June.
Negative	Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans advanced further over the intermeeting period.
Negative	Issuance in the syndicated leveraged loan market remained solid in the second quarter; terms and structures of new leveraged loan deals reportedly loosened modestly on the margin.
Negative	Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms was anemic in June and July.
Negative	Financial conditions in the commercial real estate market remained somewhat strained against a backdrop of weak fundamentals and still-tight underwriting.
Negative	That said, issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities picked up in the second quarter.
Negative	Despite new historical lows for residential mortgage rates over the intermeeting period, refinancing activity remained relatively muted.
Negative	Evidence from the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) conducted in July indicated that mortgage underwriting standards at banks generally have not eased much from their tightest post-crisis levels.
Negative	Consumer credit expanded further in May as a result of rapid increases in student loans and, to a lesser extent, auto loans.
Negative	Delinquency rates for consumer credit remained low, likely in part because of a compositional shift of credit supply over the past few years toward the least-risky borrowers.
Negative	Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds was robust in June and July.
Negative	Net issuance of long-term bonds turned positive in the second quarter after staying in negative territory for much of the past year.
Negative	Yields on long-term general obligation municipal bonds generally followed Treasury yields lower, while default rates remained very low and CDS spreads for states were roughly unchanged on net.
Negative	Bank credit and total loans continued to expand modestly in the second quarter, largely because of the further robust increase in C&I loans.
Negative	The gradual expansion in total loans was broadly consistent with the July SLOOS, in which domestic banks generally indicated that demand strengthened for many types of loans in the second quarter and that lending standards eased somewhat, on balance, across most major loan categories.
Negative	The staff's broad nominal index for the foreign exchange value of the dollar changed little, on net, over the intermeeting period, although the dollar appreciated against the euro.
Negative	Financial markets in the euro area were volatile, as a deterioration in market sentiment gave way to periods of optimism following the euro-area summit in late June, the decision by the European Central Bank (ECB) to ease policy in early July, and indications from the ECB later in July that the central bank might take further steps to support the monetary union.
Negative	On net, European stock markets finished the period higher.
Very negative	Yield spreads on Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds over their German equivalents, which rose sharply over most of July, fell back from their intermeeting peaks but remained elevated.
Negative	Several foreign central banks eased monetary policy over the intermeeting period.
Negative	The ECB cut its benchmark policy rate by 25 basis points and reduced the rate on its overnight deposit facility to zero.
Negative	The Bank of England increased the size of its asset purchase program and announced details on its new program designed to boost bank lending to the nonfinancial sector.
Negative	The central banks of Brazil, China, and South Korea all reduced official rates as well.
Negative	Amid policy easing in the euro area and United Kingdom, yields on German and U.K. sovereign bonds declined, with two-year German sovereign bonds trading at yields below zero.
Negative	Staff Economic Outlook
In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the July 31-August 1 FOMC meeting, the near-term projection for real GDP growth was revised down somewhat.
Negative	The revision primarily reflected a slower pace of consumer spending than the staff expected at the time of the previous projection, along with a deterioration in some forward-looking indicators.
Neutral	However, the staff's medium-term forecast for real GDP growth was little changed, as the slightly weaker underlying pace of economic activity suggested by the recent data was roughly offset by the anticipated effects of the continuation of the maturity extension program announced following the June FOMC meeting, which had not been incorporated in the previous projection.
Negative	With the restraint from fiscal policy assumed to increase next year, the staff projected that increases in real GDP would not significantly exceed the growth rate of potential output in 2013.
Negative	Thereafter, economic activity was expected to accelerate gradually, supported by an eventual easing in fiscal policy restraint, gains in consumer and business sentiment, further improvements in credit conditions, and continued accommodative monetary policy.
Negative	The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to reduce the substantial margin of slack in labor and product markets only slowly over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to remain elevated at the end of 2014.
Negative	The staff's forecast for inflation was little changed from the projection prepared for the June FOMC meeting.
Very negative	With crude oil prices expected to decline a bit from their current levels, the boost to retail food prices from the current drought in the Midwest anticipated to be only temporary and relatively small, longer-run inflation expectations remaining stable, and substantial resource slack persisting over the forecast period, the staff continued to project that inflation would be subdued through 2014.
Negative	Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook
In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that the information received since the Committee met in June suggested that economic activity had decelerated in recent months to a slower pace than they had anticipated.
Negative	Although business investment had continued to advance, consumer spending had slowed considerably since earlier in the year.
Negative	Conditions in the housing sector appeared to have improved somewhat, but from a very low level.
Negative	Indicators of manufacturing activity had softened.
Negative	Recent monthly gains in payroll employment had continued to be small, and the unemployment rate in June remained at an elevated level.
Negative	Consumer price inflation had been low in recent months, as declines in the costs of crude oil were passed through to retail energy prices.
Negative	Longer-term inflation expectations had remained stable.
Negative	Regarding the economic outlook, most participants agreed that economic growth was likely to remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up gradually.
Neutral	However, some participants indicated that they had lowered their near-term forecasts for economic growth in light of the weaker-than-expected increases in consumer spending and employment in recent months.
Negative	In addition, some participants expressed concern about the persistent headwinds restraining the pace of the recovery, including the weak housing sector, still-tight borrowing conditions for some households and firms, and fiscal restraint at all levels of government.
Negative	Many participants judged that a high level of uncertainty about possible spillovers from the fiscal and banking strains in the euro area and about the outlook for U.S. fiscal or regulatory policies was holding back household and business spending.
Negative	And they saw the possibilities of an intensification of strains in the euro area and of a sharper-than-anticipated U.S. fiscal consolidation as significant downside risks to the economic outlook.
Negative	Although participants generally agreed that improvements in recent years in the capital and liquidity of financial institutions and in the strength of household and business balance sheets have increased the resilience of the economy, some were concerned that at its current pace, the recovery was still vulnerable to adverse shocks.
Negative	Given participants' forecasts of economic activity, they generally anticipated that the unemployment rate would decline only slowly toward levels that participants judge to be consistent with the Committee's mandate.
Negative	Participants' assessments of the outlook for inflation were largely unchanged from those reported in June.
Negative	Smoothing through the effects of fluctuations in food and energy prices, participants anticipated that inflation over the medium term would remain at or below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective.
Negative	Meeting participants again exchanged views on the extent of slack in labor and product markets.
Negative	A number of participants expressed the view that structural changes in the labor market were not sufficient to explain the high level of unemployment.
Negative	Those participants saw substantial slack in resource utilization and hence continued to judge that inflation was likely to remain subdued over the medium term as the economy continued to recover.
Neutral	However, several other participants interpreted the moderate pace of the recovery as pointing to a more substantial markdown in the trajectory of potential output.
Negative	In particular, a couple of participants noted that they would have expected inflation to have fallen more in recent years if the output gap had been as substantial as some measures suggested.
Negative	One participant posited that the sharp decline in net worth and reduced credit availability in recent years not only weighed on aggregate demand, but also reduced aggregate supply by hampering new business formation and product innovation; another participant cited evidence that structural unemployment was elevated as a result of mismatches between the skills demanded by employers and those of the long-duration unemployed.
Negative	In discussing developments in the household sector, many participants noted the recent deceleration in overall consumer spending, although a couple cited new autos and tourism as areas of relative strength.
Negative	Participants saw several factors as likely contributing to slower consumer spending, including the weakness in earned income and a high level of uncertainty among households about the economic outlook.
Negative	Several pointed out that while households had made considerable progress in reducing their debt and rebuilding their savings, the deleveraging process was still ongoing, the level of housing debt remained high, and a significant number of mortgage borrowers continued to be underwater on their loans.
Negative	Home sales and construction were generally viewed as gradually improving, supported in part by historically low mortgage interest rates.
Negative	Many participants reported that house prices in their Districts were rising or had bottomed out, and several noted that their contacts saw signs of progress in reducing the overhang of unsold properties.
Neutral	However, it was noted that the reduction in inventories should be viewed cautiously because owners who are underwater on their mortgages may be withholding their homes from the market, implying a substantial "shadow" inventory.
Negative	Regarding the business sector, many participants reported that, with the exception of motor vehicle production, manufacturing activity in their Districts was slow or had declined in recent months.
Negative	Nonetheless, forward-looking surveys of orders and manufacturing production in a couple of Districts were more positive.
Negative	Energy-related activity continued to expand, and investment projects in that sector were reported to be moving forward.
Neutral	However, contacts in several Districts indicated that export demand had weakened as a result of the slowdown in economic activity in Europe; Asia; and some emerging market countries, including China.
Negative	More generally, some participants reported that their business contacts regarded the economic outlook to be highly uncertain, in part due to unresolved fiscal and regulatory matters.
Negative	Although several participants noted that the uncertainty had not led businesses in their Districts to reduce payrolls or cut back spending, others cited reports of shortfalls from business plans that could lead to cost-cutting, of restructuring to position firms for leaner operations, or even of postponed investment and hiring.
Negative	Two participants provided an update on the situation in the agricultural sector in light of the drought in the Midwest:  With crop yields projected to be down markedly and prices rising, livestock producers appeared likely to suffer losses as a result of higher input costs while crop producers would need to rely on higher prices and crop insurance to stabilize their income.
Neutral	The incoming information on inflation over the intermeeting period was largely in line with participants' expectations.
Negative	Consumer prices had decelerated as a result of the pass-through of lower crude oil costs to retail prices of gasoline and fuel oil.
Negative	Crude oil prices had turned up again more recently, but one participant noted that global inventories of oil were elevated and, with world demand easing, prices should be restrained going forward.
Negative	Participants acknowledged that the drought would likely result in a temporary run-up in consumer food prices later this year.
Negative	Nonetheless, inflation was expected to remain subdued, on balance, over coming quarters.
Negative	In explaining that outlook, participants cited the lack of upward pressure from labor costs and prices of imported commodities as well as the stability of inflation expectations.
Negative	A couple of participants referred to information from business contacts suggesting that inflation was unlikely to decline further, and a few expressed concerns that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for an extended period could erode the stability of inflation expectations over time and hence posed upside risks to the inflation outlook.
Negative	Financial markets remained sensitive to ongoing developments related to the sovereign debt and banking situation in the euro area, and participants continued to view the possibility of an intensification of strains in global financial markets as a significant downside risk to the domestic economic outlook.
Negative	Several participants indicated that recent trends in euro-area equity indexes and sovereign debt yields had not been encouraging, and some noted that the uncertainty prevailing in global financial markets was showing through in a cautious posture of investors.
Negative	Nonetheless, participants generally agreed that conditions in domestic credit markets remained more favorable than they were a year ago.
Negative	One participant pointed out that credit risk spreads--while still above pre-recession norms--may have been boosted by safe-haven demands for Treasury securities and indicated that broader financial market conditions seemed reasonably accommodative.
Negative	Banks were reported to be seeing an increase in their residential mortgage business along with a continued rise in C&I lending, especially to large firms; consumer credit was also increasing.
Negative	Participants discussed a number of policy tools that the Committee might employ if it decided to provide additional monetary accommodation to support a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.
Negative	One of the policy options discussed was an extension of the period over which the Committee expected to maintain its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent.
Negative	It was noted that such an extension might be particularly effective if done in conjunction with a statement indicating that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was likely to be maintained even as the recovery progressed.
Negative	Given the uncertainty attending the economic outlook, a few participants questioned whether the conditionality of the forward guidance was sufficiently clear, and they suggested that the Committee should consider replacing the calendar date with guidance that was linked more directly to the economic factors that the Committee would consider in deciding to raise its target for the federal funds rate, or omit the forward guidance language entirely.
Positive	Participants also exchanged views on the likely benefits and costs of a new large-scale asset purchase program.
Negative	Many participants expected that such a program could provide additional support for the economic recovery both by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and by contributing to easier financial conditions more broadly.
Negative	In addition, some participants noted that a new program might boost business and consumer confidence and reinforce the Committee's commitment to making sustained progress toward its mandated objectives.
Negative	Participants also discussed the merits of purchases of Treasury securities relative to agency MBS.
Neutral	However, others questioned the possible efficacy of such a program under present circumstances, and a couple suggested that the effects on economic activity might be transitory.
Negative	In reviewing the costs that such a program might entail, some participants expressed concerns about the effects of additional asset purchases on trading conditions in markets related to Treasury securities and agency MBS, but others agreed with the staff's analysis showing substantial capacity for additional purchases without disrupting market functioning.
Negative	Several worried that additional purchases might alter the process of normalizing the Federal Reserve's balance sheet when the time came to begin removing accommodation.
Negative	A few participants were concerned that an extended period of accommodation or an additional large-scale asset purchase program could increase the risks to financial stability or lead to a rise in longer-term inflation expectations.
Negative	Many participants indicated that any new purchase program should be sufficiently flexible to allow adjustments, as needed, in response to economic developments or to changes in the Committee's assessment of the efficacy and costs of the program.
Negative	Some participants commented on other possible tools for adding policy accommodation, including a reduction in the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances.
Negative	While a couple of participants favored such a reduction, several others raised concerns about possible adverse effects on money markets.
Negative	It was noted that the ECB's recent cut in its deposit rate to zero provided an opportunity to learn more about the possible consequences for market functioning of such a move.
Positive	In light of the Bank of England's Funding for Lending Scheme, a couple of participants expressed interest in exploring possible programs aimed at encouraging bank lending to households and firms, although the importance of institutional differences between the two countries was noted.
Negative	Committee Policy Action
The information received over the intermeeting period indicated that economic activity had decelerated in recent months, with a notable slowing in consumer spending.
Negative	Employment gains continued to be modest, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at a level that almost all members saw as elevated relative to levels consistent with the Committee's mandate.
Negative	Inflation had declined from its rate earlier in the year, mainly reflecting lower prices of crude oil and gasoline, and inflation expectations had been stable.
Negative	Members generally expected that economic growth would be moderate over coming quarters and then would pick up very gradually.
Negative	While most members did not view the    medium-run economic outlook as having changed significantly since the June meeting, several noted that they had lowered their expectations for economic growth over coming quarters.
Negative	Furthermore, members generally attached an unusually high level of uncertainty to their assessments of the economic outlook and continued to judge that the risks to economic growth were tilted to the downside because of strains in financial markets stemming from the sovereign debt and banking situation in Europe as well as the potential for a significant slowdown in global economic growth and for a sharper-than-anticipated fiscal contraction in the United States.
Negative	A number of members noted that if the recent modest rate of economic growth were to persist, the economy would be less able to weather a material adverse shock without slipping back into recession.
Negative	Most members continued to anticipate that, with longer-term inflation expectations stable and the existing slack in resource utilization being taken up very gradually, inflation would run over the medium term at a rate at or below the Committee's objective of 2 percent.
Negative	In contrast, one member thought that the economy may be operating near its current potential and, thus, that maintaining the Committee's current highly accommodative policy stance well into 2014 would pose upside risks to the inflation outlook.
Negative	The Committee had provided additional accommodation at its previous meeting by announcing the continuation of the maturity extension program through the end of the year, and more time was seen as necessary to evaluate the effects of that decision.
Positive	Nonetheless, many members expected that at the end of 2014, the unemployment rate would still be well above their estimates of its longer-term normal rate and that inflation would be at or below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent.
Negative	A number of them indicated that additional accommodation could help foster a more rapid improvement in labor market conditions in an environment in which price pressures were likely to be subdued.
Negative	Many members judged that additional monetary accommodation would likely be warranted fairly soon unless incoming information pointed to a substantial and sustainable strengthening in the pace of the economic recovery.
Neutral	Several members noted the benefits of accumulating further information that could help clarify the contours of the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the need for further policy action.
Negative	One member judged that additional accommodation would likely not be effective in improving the economic outlook and viewed the potential costs associated with such action as unacceptably high.
Negative	At the conclusion of the discussion, members agreed that they would closely monitor economic and financial developments and carefully weigh the potential benefits and costs of various tools in assessing whether additional policy action would be warranted.
Negative	With respect to the statement to be released following the meeting, members agreed that it should acknowledge the deceleration in economic activity, the small gains in employment, and the slowing in inflation reflected in the economic data over the intermeeting period.
Negative	Because most saw no significant changes in the medium-run outlook, they agreed to continue to indicate that the Committee anticipates a very gradual pickup in economic activity over time and a slow decline in unemployment, with inflation at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate.
Negative	Many members expressed support for extending the Committee's forward guidance, but they agreed to defer a decision on this matter until the September meeting in order to consider such an adjustment in the context of updates to participants' individual economic projections and the Committee's further consideration of its policy options.
Negative	The statement also reiterated the Committee's intention to extend the average maturity of its securities holdings as announced in June.
Negative	Consistent with the concerns expressed by many members about the slow pace of the economic recovery, the downside risks to economic growth, and the considerable slack in resource utilization, the Committee decided that the statement should conclude by indicating that it will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.
Negative	At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

    "The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
Negative	To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent.
Negative	The Committee directs the Desk to continue the maturity extension program it announced in June to purchase Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years with a total face value of about $267 billion by the end of December 2012, and to sell or redeem Treasury securities with remaining maturities of approximately 3 years or less with a total face value of about $267 billion.
Negative	For the duration of this program, the Committee directs the Desk to suspend its current policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues.
Negative	The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in the System Open Market Account in agency mortgage-backed securities.
Negative	These actions should maintain the total face value of domestic securities at approximately $2.6 trillion.
Negative	The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions.
Negative	The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
Negative	The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:15 p.m.:

    "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that economic activity decelerated somewhat over the first half of this year.
Negative	Growth in employment has been slow in recent months, and the unemployment rate remains elevated.
Positive	Business fixed investment has continued to advance.
Negative	Household spending has been rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year.
Negative	Despite some further signs of improvement, the housing sector remains depressed.
Negative	Inflation has declined since earlier this year, mainly reflecting lower prices of crude oil and gasoline, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
Negative	Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.
Negative	The Committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up very gradually.
Negative	Consequently, the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only slowly toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.
Negative	Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.
Negative	The Committee anticipates that inflation over the medium term will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate.
Negative	To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy.
Negative	In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.
Negative	The Committee also decided to continue through the end of the year its program to ex-tend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in June, and it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.
Negative	The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments and will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability."
Negative	Voting for this action:  Ben Bernanke, William C. Dudley, Elizabeth Duke, Dennis P. Lockhart, Sandra Pianalto, Jerome H. Powell, Sarah Bloom Raskin, Jeremy C. Stein, Daniel K. Tarullo, John C. Williams, and Janet L. Yellen.
Neutral	Voting against this action:  Jeffrey M. Lacker.
Negative	Mr. Lacker dissented because he did not believe that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate were likely to be warranted for the length of time specified in the Committee's statement.
Negative	In his view, significant uncertainty regarding the evolution of economic conditions over the next few years made the future path of interest rates difficult to forecast, and the Committee's statement implied more confidence on this score than justified by the current outlook.
Negative	Consensus Forecast Experiment
In light of the discussion at the previous FOMC meeting, the subcommittee on communications developed an initial experimental exercise intended to shed light on the feasibility and desirability of constructing an FOMC consensus forecast.
Negative	At this meeting, participants discussed various aspects of the exercise, such as the possible monetary policy assumptions on which to condition an FOMC consensus forecast, the measurement of the degree of uncertainty surrounding each of the projected variables in the forecast, and the potential for communications benefits.
Negative	In conclusion, participants generally expressed support for a second exercise to be undertaken in conjunction with the September FOMC meeting.
Negative	It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Wednesday-Thursday, September 12-13, 2012.
Negative	The meeting adjourned at 2:15 p.m. on August 1, 2012.
Negative	Notation Vote
By notation vote completed on July 10, 2012, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the FOMC meeting held on June 19-20, 2012.
