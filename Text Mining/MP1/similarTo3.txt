COMPARING TO : In the basement of United Nations building, this restaurant feels like an upscale izakaya. We sat in a middle booth. We ordered draft Sapporo ($7) which came with 2 inches of foam and in a less than a pint size glass. The service was fairly slow but not unbearable once we got our full bottle of unfiltered shirakawago sake. The bottle was set on the table on ice in a beautiful wooden container with flower. We ordered: Sashimi: Tuna, amberjack, mackerel, red snapper, and salmon with iruka (instead of the uni) b/c [my dinner mates are not adventurous eaters]. Each piece was spectacularly thick and supple. The roe on the salmon was best I have ever eaten. It was sweet with a touch of brine instead of the other way around. A+ for presentation. Tuna Tartare with yellow and black masago on a bed of thinly sliced cucumbers. Roasted Duck slices served cold and wrapped around a bundle of soy marinated Daikon topped with a dot of pea sauce and half moon lemon slices. This dish is about contrast. The fatty and chewy meat plays excellently against salty crispy radish and the finish of citrus just brightens the bite. Chawamushi: Steam Egg custard with mushroom in a sour chicken broth. It had similar flavor profile to Cantonese hot n sour soup. It is a bit more asian than rest of our food order. We had chicken two ways. First was the jidori shioyaki. Crispy chicken skin. Grilled served with salt and miso.  Second was the tori-karaage which a fancy term for fried chicken. Five almost too big pieces of poultry. I am not sure why lofan people always leave the vegetal side. The lettuce with the fried chicken was less decadent. Beef. We had the signature ishiyaki which was thinly sliced beef slices cooked on top of a hot stone. (See the video). We also had the steak which paled in comparison. Finally NOODLES. Inaniwa Udon served hot in a clear broth. It was so refreshing eating just noodles, broth, and spinach. The noodles were Al dente and very slurp-able. The broth was light and fresh but had firm flavor.  This is what you should order. Dessert. Black sesame creme br?l��e with black sesame ice cream.  Not so much burnt sugar but the Asian twist on this french dessert was rather delicious.

best.dining.experience.ever.the service was excellent save for a few missteps and one server who was quite stonefaced.  also, all of us got the tour except for my wife who got the veggie tour and it was excellent too!  we couldn't have asked for a better evening!  perfection!here's the course by course break down:osetra, traditional garnishes -very much like thomas keller's oysters and pearls but a modern twist (and no oysters).  very light w/ perfect caviar.pork belly, iceberg, cucumber, thai distillation -their play on thai food and it was unreal. pork belly was excellent but what stole the show was the shot of a liquified thai chilies which smelled like it was spicy but had the pure flavor of the chilies w/out the heat.oxalis, juniper, gin, sugar -a gelee dish. it had a bitter flavor which worked well with the flavors of the berries, gin and sugar.lilac, scallop, shellfish, honeydew -this was quite a dish! the base was a lilac "pillow" that had essence of lilac. the seafood was incredible and so perfectly cooked. the honeydew foam added a nice sweet accent.pigeonneau, a la saint-clair -chef achatz showed us that he's not all about new styles of cooking. this was a classically prepared dish and was fabulous. the squab, foie gras, and the onions were exquisite and we couldn't have asked for a more perfect crust.black truffle explosion, romaine, parmesan -one of his signatures and it didn't disappoint. it's just one bite but as soon as it enters the mouth, the insides of the ravioli come out and all you're left w/ is black truffles in all of its glory.tomato, fig, nicoise olive, pine nuts -basil leaves and tomato stems that provide the aromatic blanket for this course.  a whole salad re-thought! there are olives, black garlic, charred figs and olive oil snow! a great combo of flavors and a dehydrated pumpernickel crouton added some nice texture. the heirloom tomatoes were so good!mustard, passionfruit, allspicebacon, butterscotch, apple, thymesweet potato, bourbon, brown sugar, cinnamon -the mustard ice cream w/ allspice and passionfruit were presented as a disc and we were asked to let it melt in our mouth. it went from spicy to light to sweet. a very cool effect!  the bacon first and it wa perfection. sweet, salty w/ a herb twist w/ the thyme. the sweet potato was basically pie on a stick and perfect way to end the trio. sweet, creamy and w/ a nice bite.hot potato, cold potato, black truffle, butter -another signature of his. we had to pick up the bowl and pull the pin on the side so that the hot contents of the pin would drop in the cold soup and eat right away. the contrast of the temperatures and textures added to an already incredible flavorful dish!yuba, shrimp, miso, togarashi -the yuba (skin of tofu) was hardened and fried to give it a crispy texture. the shrimp was delicious and had the miso dip was outstanding!foie gras, peach, fennel, shiso -the foie gras and fennel which needed to be eaten right away and then the peach juice in the cup needed to be drunk right away. the savory and sweet is the mix here and it tasted nice!uni, aloe, yuzu, chili -this dish made its debut on the menu that night and we were asked by a lot of the wait staff on how we liked it. while uni isn't my thing, this was void of any weird fishy flavor or a weird texture. the flavor worked well w/ the yuzu and aloe but it was inconsistent from bite to bite.wagyu beef, powdered a-1, potato chips -wow! i've never had beef this good. the potato "chips" was like a cube of all that is good w/ potatoes. the powdered A-1 was a deconstructed version of A-1 steak sauce and was a nice addition as was the salt and pepper on the side but the beef really stood on its own.lemon soda, one bite -once in your mouth, this almost becomes a bite of lemon meringue. great and playful!transparency of raspberry, yogurtbubble gum, long pepper, hibiscus, creme fraichewatermelon, lime, nasturtium -this was a thin paper of raspberry which was a fun fruit roll up type thing and a "cigarette" of bubble gum w/ creme fraiche that needed to be sucked from the one side and a ball of watermelon w/ lime. just a fun course!rhubarb, goat milk, onion, lavender air -a pillow filled w/ lavender air was placed in front of us and the dish was placed on top.  the pillow slowly lost it's air as the plate sat and gave off this wonderful lavender aroma. The bites on the plate had a lil bit of cotton candy to drops of sweet onion. nice dish.chocolate, blueberry, tobacco, maple -the highlight of the evening. A silicone mat was placed on our table top and chef achatz prepped this on our table and every component was insanely good.  here's a video of this course: bit.ly/vWIQSpound cake, strawberry, lemon, vanilla bean -a dense pound cake w/ strawberry in it and a lemon snow around it. the vanilla bean is used as a fork and adds a nice background flavor. lovely!

Alinea may as well be called "Alien-a" because it's simply an OUT OF THIS WORLD culinary experience!!!Haha that was cheesy.  Onward...Not too long ago I watched the Andrew Zimmern Bizarre Foods episode where he dined at Alinea.  I was fascinated by the crazy contraptions used to create their culinary creations and immediately put this restaurant on my "must try sometime in my life" list.  Then I realized it was also a 3-starred Michelin Restaurant. THEN I was sent to a work trip out to Chicago.  AND my boyfriend just happened to have a work trip that brought him out to Chicago the same week.  Needless to say it was meant to be for us two foodies to pay this place a visit."Subtle" would be the word I have for this location, but I'm too excited about the food so I'm diving right in (there ARE 22 dishes, after all).The first course composed of 3 mini-servings of "frozen drinks", all meant to be consumed in a single bite.1) Lemon - luxardo bitter, luxardo amaro, grapefruit:  a frozen bite of liquor lifted with a delicate pin - a bit bitter for me but a good refreshing start to the meal.2) Apple - laird's apple brandy, grenadine, thyme: a piece of crunchy apple encapsulated in a jelly liquor served on a circular spoon - once again a foreign and enlightening experience for the taste buds3) Squash - cynar, carpano antica, flor de cana 7 year: served on a mini tower, a flan-like substance with a tasty foam.  This was my favorite of the three, likely because it was the sweetest.4) Steelhead Roe - dijon, retabaga, grapefruit:  creamy, full of "umami", zero hint of fishiness paired with the essence of grapefruit.. simply delicious. 5) Yuba - Shrimp, miso, togarashi: a crunchy twist of fried tofu skin, wrapped with tender shrimp and dipped in a perfectly seasoned miso sauce.  The asian side of me is comforted by this little "snack".6) Urchin - watercress, vanilla, mint: A vanilla "jello" of sorts encapsulating a small piece of sea urchin.  A small bite exploding in different flavors... I can't even describe this one because it was a medley of the strangest flavors popping in and out of my mouth.  This dish ends with a sip of watercress soup served beneath the jello.7) Halibut - black pepper, coffee, lemon: One of my favorite dishes of the night and presented in a snowy-white art form.  The fish was perfectly cooked, the hint of coffee flavor permeated occasionally, the crunchy "shrimp chips" and the flawless cream sauce played together in a strange, but perfect harmony. YUM.8) Rabbit - Parfait, rillett, consommé: A three-tiered dish (literally, served in a 3 tiered cylindrical bowl) beginning with a cool rabbit parfait on the top layer that was creamy yet refreshing, culminated to a rabbit meat medley (a cube of shredded meat alongside a fried ball of meat) covered in king trumpet mushroom and surrounded by butternut sauce, and finally ending with a clear rabbit broth kept warm by a hot stone and flavored with a stick of cinnamon.9) Wlid mushrooms - pine, sumac, ramp: Loving this mushroom medley of wild mushrooms from the Fresno foothills in CA (what what)... weirdly spongy but super flavorful... another favorite.10) Hot Potato - cold potato, black truffle, butter: Another creative sip of soup served on a mini wax bowl with a pin poking through, spearing a bite of potato, black truffle, and frozen butter.  Pulling the pin releases these items into a cold potato broth... this dish was particularly different.11) Short Rib - olive, red wine, blackberry: Yet another favorite dish.  Earlier during dinner we were presented with 2 red "flags" in criss cross formation, which seemed a strange table decor. At this point we realized that this "flag" was an edible homemade tomato pasta.  This pasta was then draped over a metal, cradlelike contraption that made space for the most tender and tasty short rib I've ever eaten.  A plate of sides and sauces containing sea salt, olives, blackberry, sour cherry were all fair game to garnish this "pasta short rib wrap".  Likely the most luxurious "wrap" I will ever eat; I was blown away.12) Hamachi - West Indies spices, banana, ginger: served on a smoldering piece of cinnamon, this fried dish had a very "Indian" vibe to it although the banana felt like the centerpiece.13) Canard - a la Cussy: Lots of "best of"s during this meal, but this was the BEST DUCK I'VE EVER HAD.  A puff pastry stuffed with duck innards, foie gras, cock's crest (first time trying... it was good), and topped with the 3 most tender slices of duck I've ever had along with a tiny piece of fried duck skin.  I was getting really full at this point but I had to push through... 14) Venison - cherry, cocoa nib, eucalyptus: Once again, most tender piece of venison I've ever had.  Not gamey, served on a "lily pad" like presentation that covered the bite of deer heaven.To be continued... yelp's 5000 word limit can't stop me...

Had dinner there but probably should have tried the one across the street and enjoyed a nice dinner.  It was just too packed to be enjoyable and feels like a wanna be place...We tried the grappa cured salmon w/ sweet & sour cucumbers.  The salmon was ok, it was thick small pieces...but the sweet & sour cucumbers were very good and refreshing.  For dinner, we had the Prosciutto d'Anitra pizza and the linguine w/ clam in white sauce.  The pizza was ok at best but the pasta was good, al dente.
