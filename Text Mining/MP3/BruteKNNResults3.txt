Input Query: In the basement of United Nations building, this restaurant feels like an upscale izakaya. We sat in a middle booth. We ordered draft Sapporo ($7) which came with 2 inches of foam and in a less than a pint size glass. The service was fairly slow but not unbearable once we got our full bottle of unfiltered shirakawago sake. The bottle was set on the table on ice in a beautiful wooden container with flower. We ordered: Sashimi: Tuna, amberjack, mackerel, red snapper, and salmon with iruka (instead of the uni) b/c [my dinner mates are not adventurous eaters]. Each piece was spectacularly thick and supple. The roe on the salmon was best I have ever eaten. It was sweet with a touch of brine instead of the other way around. A+ for presentation. Tuna Tartare with yellow and black masago on a bed of thinly sliced cucumbers. Roasted Duck slices served cold and wrapped around a bundle of soy marinated Daikon topped with a dot of pea sauce and half moon lemon slices. This dish is about contrast. The fatty and chewy meat plays excellently against salty crispy radish and the finish of citrus just brightens the bite. Chawamushi: Steam Egg custard with mushroom in a sour chicken broth. It had similar flavor profile to Cantonese hot n sour soup. It is a bit more asian than rest of our food order. We had chicken two ways. First was the jidori shioyaki. Crispy chicken skin. Grilled served with salt and miso.  Second was the tori-karaage which a fancy term for fried chicken. Five almost too big pieces of poultry. I am not sure why lofan people always leave the vegetal side. The lettuce with the fried chicken was less decadent. Beef. We had the signature ishiyaki which was thinly sliced beef slices cooked on top of a hot stone. (See the video). We also had the steak which paled in comparison. Finally NOODLES. Inaniwa Udon served hot in a clear broth. It was so refreshing eating just noodles, broth, and spinach. The noodles were Al dente and very slurp-able. The broth was light and fresh but had firm flavor.  This is what you should order. Dessert. Black sesame creme br?l��e with black sesame ice cream.  Not so much burnt sugar but the Asian twist on this french dessert was rather delicious.

Result: This has been a long time coming, really.  In actuality, it's a travesty I didn't review this restaurant first.  This, to me, is the penultimate experience in sushi in the greater los angeles area.  I don't mean just in little Tokyo, I mean in the entire LA county.  While I can't claim to have tried every top flight sushi restaurant (urasawa is gonna be for a special occasion in the future), I have been eating sushi for 15+ years, up and down California, and without a doubt, sushi gen is my go to spot.  When someone asks me what I feel like eating at any given time, its sushi gen.  I have brought all of my friends that visit me to this wonderful establishment, and they all tell me I have excellent taste in food.  I wish I could take the credit, but to not like sushi gen must mean your taste buds must be allergic to excellence.You have the option of either eating at the bar (omakase style only, minimum of 4 orders per person) or at the tables.  When I come here, usually in small parties (between 2-5 people), I go for the table.  My go to meal?  The sashimi dinner with a side of tempura ($26).  I think 95% of the time I have dined at the table, I get that.   All the dinner plates start with miso soup, tsunemono, and pickled vegetables (usually a cucumber and cabbage concoction).  Lets start with the miso soup.  I feel like you can judge a good sushi restaurant by the attention to detail in the miso soup, having the correct ratio of dashi to miso paste, as well as having the tofu be unbroken.  Sushi gen hits all three of these aspects wonderfully; this is how I know this is the precursor to a wonderful meal.  The tsunemono is deliciously sweet and tart at the same time, serving to counterbalance the saltiness of the pickled vegetables and miso soup.  The salty pickled vegetables are the weakest part of the trio, but it's refreshing when eaten in conjunction with the other two items.After that comes the main course: a plate full of sashimi, a bowl of perfectly cooked hot sushi rice, and a side of shrimp and vegetable tempura.  The tempura itself is delicious; not too heavy, crispy, crunchy, and piping hot.  It's the perfect side to a cold plate of heavenly sashimi.  The usual suspects in an order of the sashimi dinner?  3 slices of tuna (sometimes fattier, sometimes leaner), 3 slices of hamachi, their house special spicy tuna (I guarantee you its like no other spicy tuna you've ever had), chunks of yellowtail, chunks of regular tuna, tamago, either tako or ikura (octopus or squid), some sweet preserved fish (this is indistinguishable to me), and a cooked piece of salmon (kind of the odd man out), all served with a generous helping of seaweed.  The specifics are up to the sushi chefs, but it usually comes out like that in some fashion.  All of the fish is of the highest quality, although I wish they served salmon sashimi instead of the cooked salmon (they don't make substitutions).  A comparable plate would cost 3-4 times as much at any other establishment west of downtown (sasabune and hide sushi come to mind, but I'll be honest, those restaurants pale in comparison), and the portions are so generous it borders on the obscene.  For my money, the sashimi dinner combo is the best meal in town, and I will challenge you to a duel if you dare dispute this.I've also had the pleasure of trying their various appetizers, from the ankimo to their fried chicken, and the quality of the food is definitely there.  But honestly, if you are going to go to a sushi restaurant in the heart of Little Tokyo, you should be eating the raw goods and eschew the cooked.I've only eaten the omakase once before, but I must say, it was absolutely delightful.  While I am sure there are better authorities than I to the world of omakase, the flavour pairings and the order of the fish prepared by the chef were simply superb.  From what I recall, we started with the prototypical orders of fish, including toro, hamachi, and mackerel.  It pains me to say it, but the quality of the fish served with the omakase is just out of this world, just a cut above what is offered to the main restaurant.  Pun intended.  We proceeded with other more adventurous fare: albacore with thinly sliced green onions, mirugai with a touch of yuzu pepper for added kick, and scallops so sweet it threatens to overwhelm.  A nice touch is that the chef intersperses the orders in a way where some of the nigiri you eat with soy sauce, and some you don't; he will tell you beforehand what the proper way of eating the order is.  The amaebi is also exceptionally sweet, with the fried head serving as a textural counterpoint to the sweet shrimp.  The only downside to the omakase?  It can easily run you 50+ per person before sake, which ups the joint a dollar sign.  It's a bit more decadent than the table meal, but either way, you can't go wrong with Sushi Gen.

Result: This was great particularly for the value -- Sashimi Dinner included large plate of sashimi + miso soup + tempura for less than $30 I believe.  The plate of sashimi included mostly variations of tuna but no salmon except for a cooked piece, which was disappointing as cooked salmon is really common.  The pieces of tuna were mildly fatty-- just the way I like it (and just the way I've heard the Japanese like it).  The tempura was delightful - light, crispy, vegetables not soggy.  The wait was horrible though.  Make a reservation if you can.  Sit at the bar for sushi only (no dinner menu options).  Table next to me had an Uni dinner which looked yummy - like a whole box of uni for ~$36-40 I think.  They also serve Iced Green Tea which is matcha (?) in water and ice (unsweetened).  Parking in their lot requires a fee I think.  I went on a weekday and found street parking after circling a few times.

Result: I came here on a Sunday at 3:30 and there was still a long wait. That says alot about this brunch. I also love that they serve brunch this late. I ordered the Blu Jam Eggs Benedict and as Benny connoisuer, this definitely gets a stamp of approval! The hollandaise sauce was light and flavorful- not too salty. Instead of a thick cut piece of Canadian Ham, it was served with thinly sliced Black forrest ham AND crispy BACON.Oh and served with a side of country potates. Need I say more? This was all washed down with fresh squeezed OJ and freshly brewed coffee. My date got a breakfast burrito wrap that was also very tasty! I'm craving to come back here and try the french toast that I saw on the table next to me. Very cute place with excellent service and food!

Result: Definitely one of the tastiest meals that I've ever had. I went here with a friend for Restaurant Week and, unlike those restaurants that shove forth their cheapest, most uninventive fare during this event, Toro's offerings really showcased its talents well.Between the two of us, we ordered a multitude of dishes to share. The portion sizes are small--tasting sizes really--but each bite packed in so much flavour that there's no way to leave unsatisfied. Here's a breakdown:Ensalada Favorita (Romaine, tahini-miso dressing, grilled croutons, radishes, carrots and mahon cheese): nice and refreshing, but nothing too special. The nutty dressing contrasted well with the crunchy greens. A good way to balance our meat-heavy meal but otherwise, something that you can easily make at home.Datiles con Jamon (Medjool dates filled with Marcona almonds and Cabrales blue cheese, wrapped in Jamon Serrano):  The salty-sweet dialogue that the chef was aiming for didn't really balance out, as I found  the sweetness of the date a bit too overpowering! Great flavour combo, just a bit too intense on the sweet side.Atun Tartare (Tuna tartare with coconut milk, calamansi lime and cilantro): HIghly recommended. Tuna tartare gently seasoned so as to still allow the tuna-ness to shine through, served with toast. Very refreshing.Mollejas (Kung Pao style sweetbreads with blood orange, fermented black beans and hazelnuts): Very Asian flavours at work here. Two pieces of fried sweetbreads with a tangy sweet and sour sauce. I'm not a big fan of sweet + sour but the sweetbreads were excellent: great textural contrast between the crispy outside and the creamy insides.Uni Bocadillo (Pressed uni sandwich with miso butter and pickled mustard seeds): This dish was featured (along with the sweetbreads) in Food Network's "Unique Eats." I LOVE uni, and I love how they served it heated up but still uncooked so that it retains its creaminess and gooey texture, but the miso made it waaayyy too salty. Diluting the saltiness with another piece of bread worked, but lessening the salt would much improve this otherwise impressive dish.Coliflor a la Plancha (Cauliflower with pine nuts, golden raisins and pimenton de la vera): Get a bit of each ingredient in one bite. Flawless.Fennel sausage with pimento sauce: Perfectly spiced sausage paired with a sweet-spicy pimento salsa. No complaints here at all.For dessert we had the manchego cheese with quince paste, which tasted as good as this classic combination goes (I'm not a big fan of hard cheeses so I don't have much to say about it). The churros with chocolate sauce also garner no complaints.Delicious meal, impressive flavours, and inventive combinations. Definitely looking forward to coming back!

Result: Gosh, my review before was short.  It's okay, I can make it up now.  They close between lunch and dinner, so don't come here in the middle of the day. Upon entering the small parking lot, you will need to grab a ticket from the machine.  Don't forget to validate it before you leave, so your parking fee will only be $2.50.  There's metered parking on the street as well, but sometimes it's tough to find a good spot.We got here around 5:15 on a Monday night.  They open at 5:30 for dinner, and already there were 7 parties before us waiting.  We were still sat right away though.  Looking around the room, most people order the sashimi or sushi set dinners, since they are great deals.  Since I'm cutting back on eating raw fish, yes I know it sucks, I ordered a few cooked appetizer dishes.For sure one of the great things about their menu is that it does cater to everyone.  They have the more "americanized" items like beef or chicken teriyaki bento to the izakaya style tapas to fresh sashimi and sushi.I ordered the Salmon skin salad, Ankimo (monkfish liver), Ume-Shio cut roll and Grilled Yellowtail collar.  My dinner-mates all ordered the sashimi dinner.  We also ordered Uni sashimi for the table to share.Salmon skin salad was just okay.  Nothing to rave about.  Actually I barely had an salmon skin.  Ankimo was delicious and fresh!  By the way, ankimo is not a raw dish.  It's steamed, but served cold.  Ume-shiso cut roll was not the best I've had.  It was more salty than sour.  Ikko actually makes the best ume-shiso cut roll.  The yellowtail collar was grilled perfectly and just super tasty!  The portion was also rather large too!  I couldn't even finish it, had to share.  The uni was super duper fresh!  When ordering sashimi, they give you the whole box plus a side of chopped fatty tuna.  It's all accompanied with sliced cucumbers and crispy seaweed.  It's $30, but so worth it.The sashimi dinner was a ridiculously large portion!  All for only $26!  You get two small starts of pickled cucumber and a sunomono.  Then you get a big bowl of rice and a plate of mixed tempura.  Finally a full plate of fresh assorted sashimi.  My dinner mates were very satisfied and full.  The servers were also very nice and filled our hot teas regularly.  Oh, they have lots of ice creams and mochi ice creams for dessert as well as exotic fresh fruits such as cherimoya.  Definitely a great place to go for fresh and delicious Japanese for a good price!
