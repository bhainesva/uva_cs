Input Query: In the basement of United Nations building, this restaurant feels like an upscale izakaya. We sat in a middle booth. We ordered draft Sapporo ($7) which came with 2 inches of foam and in a less than a pint size glass. The service was fairly slow but not unbearable once we got our full bottle of unfiltered shirakawago sake. The bottle was set on the table on ice in a beautiful wooden container with flower. We ordered: Sashimi: Tuna, amberjack, mackerel, red snapper, and salmon with iruka (instead of the uni) b/c [my dinner mates are not adventurous eaters]. Each piece was spectacularly thick and supple. The roe on the salmon was best I have ever eaten. It was sweet with a touch of brine instead of the other way around. A+ for presentation. Tuna Tartare with yellow and black masago on a bed of thinly sliced cucumbers. Roasted Duck slices served cold and wrapped around a bundle of soy marinated Daikon topped with a dot of pea sauce and half moon lemon slices. This dish is about contrast. The fatty and chewy meat plays excellently against salty crispy radish and the finish of citrus just brightens the bite. Chawamushi: Steam Egg custard with mushroom in a sour chicken broth. It had similar flavor profile to Cantonese hot n sour soup. It is a bit more asian than rest of our food order. We had chicken two ways. First was the jidori shioyaki. Crispy chicken skin. Grilled served with salt and miso.  Second was the tori-karaage which a fancy term for fried chicken. Five almost too big pieces of poultry. I am not sure why lofan people always leave the vegetal side. The lettuce with the fried chicken was less decadent. Beef. We had the signature ishiyaki which was thinly sliced beef slices cooked on top of a hot stone. (See the video). We also had the steak which paled in comparison. Finally NOODLES. Inaniwa Udon served hot in a clear broth. It was so refreshing eating just noodles, broth, and spinach. The noodles were Al dente and very slurp-able. The broth was light and fresh but had firm flavor.  This is what you should order. Dessert. Black sesame creme br?l��e with black sesame ice cream.  Not so much burnt sugar but the Asian twist on this french dessert was rather delicious.

Result: Had dinner there but probably should have tried the one across the street and enjoyed a nice dinner.  It was just too packed to be enjoyable and feels like a wanna be place...We tried the grappa cured salmon w/ sweet & sour cucumbers.  The salmon was ok, it was thick small pieces...but the sweet & sour cucumbers were very good and refreshing.  For dinner, we had the Prosciutto d'Anitra pizza and the linguine w/ clam in white sauce.  The pizza was ok at best but the pasta was good, al dente.

Result: Cochon, after one night of dining there, is now one of my all-time favorite restaurants.Since I worship at the temple of pork and pork-related foods, there really isn't a better concept for a restaurant than to have on centered around that very thing. So when I knew I was coming out to New Orleans, this restaurant became a top priority.I'm so glad I ate here.Our first meal, however, was not pork. It was fried alligator with chili-garlic aioli. I've had alligator before, and it wavers between delicious and rubber. This night's alligator was firmly in the middle. The sauce was spectacular, though, despite the overly chewy (even for gator) nature of the dish.The second dish was healthier, as I wanted something fresh to counteract the utter destruction of my body that was to follow. To my delight, the dish, cucumbers with herbs and vinegar, was simple, refreshing and sublime. Next came our first pork venture, barbecue ribs with watermelon pickles. What else can I say? Perfection. Great sauce, the rib meat was falling off the bone, and the pickles added a sweet and sour kick to the already tangy and sweet barbeque sauce. A winner.Next, deep fried boudin with fresh mustard and hot peppers. Boudin already rocks on its own, so to deep fry those suckers is to create one of the most delicious plates I've had in awhile. Pure awesomeness.The next dish was ham hocks with sweet potato, pickled greens and black eyed peas. The ham hocks came in their own jus, which made me happy. The flavors were really beyond description, a truly perfect blend of sweet, salty, and sour - all my favorite things, especially with pork.And then came the namesake dish of the restaurant - cochon with cracklins and turnips. Juicy and delicious, it truly knocked my socks off. And when cracklins (pork rinds) are just accompaniments for an already porky fabulous dish, you know you're in hog heaven.We finished with a root-beer parfait that was a nice, refreshing palate cleanser after the porky apocalypse that my stomach was subjected to.

Result: I came here on a Sunday at 3:30 and there was still a long wait. That says alot about this brunch. I also love that they serve brunch this late. I ordered the Blu Jam Eggs Benedict and as Benny connoisuer, this definitely gets a stamp of approval! The hollandaise sauce was light and flavorful- not too salty. Instead of a thick cut piece of Canadian Ham, it was served with thinly sliced Black forrest ham AND crispy BACON.Oh and served with a side of country potates. Need I say more? This was all washed down with fresh squeezed OJ and freshly brewed coffee. My date got a breakfast burrito wrap that was also very tasty! I'm craving to come back here and try the french toast that I saw on the table next to me. Very cute place with excellent service and food!
