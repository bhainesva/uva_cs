Result: Good just expensive. We got carry out so that we could avoid the lines. We ordered chicken (7 out of 10), brisket (10), pork ribs (9) and peach cobbler. I usually love chicken but the ribs and brisket  were better. The peach cobbler was good but  a bit too sweet to finish it all.

Result: Everything was very good. We had the peach sangria and lots of plates. I can't remember everything but we had asparagus, spicy potatoes, beef tenderloin which was awesome!, shrimp, deserts. Definitely had a lot more plates but everything just seemed delicious. Cool place with a lively, vibrant atmosphere and attentive service.
