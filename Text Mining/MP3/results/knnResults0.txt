Input Query: Ahhh tapas, the small plates that contain individual tiny bites of joy. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba does their versions very well.In a group of 8, celebrating a birthday, many of the tapas were sampled and many drinks were to be had. Four of us split a pitcher of peach sangria, which was very good, each of us got two full glasses and there was a little top off to spare. As far as the food I personally took bites of:Bacon wrapped dates (5/5)Steak skewers (4/5)Spicy Potatotes (4/5)Fried Green Peppers (3/5) andPaella Valenciana (5/5)Braised short ribs w/mashed potatoes (5/5)Dessert - Chocolate Truffle Cake (3/5)You can't go wrong with bacon wrapped dates. The steak skewers and spicy potatoes were more impressive because of the sauce pairings. The fried green peppers were good, just not much to them, not a punch in the bite like I like my tapas. The paella was my favorite paella ever, mostly because paella usually comes with seafood and this one did not. Also it was done well. The braised short ribs I got to myself and every mouthful was very succulent and exactly like I would have wanted and was expecting. The chocolate cake was standard, nothing impressive, but good all the same. Service was around, clearing plates and making sure we got what all of our orders. Very impressive, especially since the concept of tapas induces a higher service standard than restaurants with the normal three plates.I can't wait to take the Mister here to show him how to eat like we do in España.
===========================

Result: I enjoy almost all of their dishes...but let me be honest, I'm going there for the Sangria.  The staff is hit or miss and it's very loud but almost always have a great time

Result: GREAT FOR GROUPS!Went for a friend's bday party and liked it a lot. The servers are friendly and efficient! Enjoyed the meal a lot!

Result: Piece offers a super enormous dining room, their own selection of beers, and terrific pizza. This place, be warned has a really high pixel to human ratio, so if you prefer to dine without commentary by John Madden, it may not be for you. Also offered: Live Band Karaoke. Totally fun.

Result: Big Star is awesome.  I feel really cool when I go here.  Tacos de panza are the best.  $3 whiskey shots = good/bad depending on your situation.  Michelada's are refreshing.  Paul Kahan spins some mad tunes.

Result: I know, it seems absurd, but it really is as amazing an experience as everyone says. It's just a blast. And if you'd like to justify it, it's really only the price of 4 average meals in Chicago.. right?  I'll be starting an "Alinea" fund to do it every year. Every bite was delicious, plus fun.
