Input Query: My mouth is watering writing this review. Omg, these tacos are EVERYTHING and then some,imo. Los Tacos offers no tables to sit at, like more than half of the other spots at the market don't either. The line was composed of about 40 people when I got there, and the wait was probably about 10-15 minutes.... but the wait is extremely worth it. Their steak and pork tacos are fantastic. Their pico de gallo is tangy, but not over the top spicy. Holy crap. These are by far the fastest and tastiest tacos that have ever graced my mouth. Their pork tacos have freaking pineapple in them? I've never had this combo and I'm dying to have some more of them right now. The employees are really friendly and move efficiently fast. The price? about $3 dollars a taco. WHAT? yes. The tacos are made by a Mexican staff? YES! That's probably why they're so damn good. Something to keep in mind though, after you pay and receive your ticket, move quickly to the other side and give that other person your ticket. If you assume that after you pay, your ticket number or order will be called out for you to come get it, you will be waiting there for a longgggggg time.
===========================

Result: Definitely one of the best in town.  I like every menu item on here especially the Brisket.   Never has been dry - just the right combination of lean/fat,.    Line seems longer than it really is.  To go is an easy process.   Can't go wrong with any of the sides either.

Result: Great Bar.  Great Food. I loved the shrimp and grits.  It was so amazingly flavorful.

Result: Mmmm mmmmm delish!!! The Mac and cheese is delish!! Pulled meat sandwiches are great!

Result: the shrimp n grits and grilled oysters were yummy. great service in the middle of mardibgras weekend .the burger looked ridic and most couples were sharing one with eeach having their own truffle fries. check it out!

Result: My old office was a few blocks away from Smoque.  It was a delight to lunch there regularly. It got a bit crowded after the Food Network exposure but the food stayed tasty. Chatting with the owner and anybody of staff was also a pleasure.
