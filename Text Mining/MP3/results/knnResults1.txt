Input Query: This was our last meal on our Chicago trip and we chose it after hearing great things about this place from our friend who used to live in the area. My husband and I came for an early dinner and the restaurant was pretty empty and quiet. We shared the following: - Avocado crostini: so tasty!! It's a delicious and light appetizer great for sharing! So fresh and delicious! Honestly, it's very simple and I could probably make this at home, but I had no regrets ordering it. Definitely recommend this one! - Lobster ravioli: I was pretty disappointed by this dish. It was a little on the bland side, and I wished it had more of a lemony citrusy flavor. - Pumpkin ravioli w/ butternut squash: delicious!!! I loved this dish. The flavor is amazing! It's seriously like autumn on a plate. Sweet, savory, and the sage is just perfection! One of the best pasta dishes I've ever had! - Panna cotta: this was definitely not your average panna cotta. It was actually a chocolate flavor which took me by surprise. They nailed the texture though! Overall, the panna cotta was good, but a little too rich for my personal liking. If you like desserts like decadent chocolate pudding, get this. Service was phenomenal! 5 stars for the service alone. The manager and server both took great care of us throughout the night. We felt like honorary guests! I would recommend this place just based on the amazing hospitality and service we received.

Result: 1,757 previous reviews?How odd then that my review number coincides with the exact number of calories I take in every time I stop here when drunk.

Result: Chargrilled Oysters, nuff said! The shrimp and oyster po boy and etoufee were excellent as well, we ate here 3 times in 5 days, yep.....

Result: French Fry heaven.. seriously.  small spot but doesn't matter once you shovel the fries in ur mouth and dip them into the many sauces they over.  I really have a scary obsession with french fries.. thank you pomme frites

Result: I like the neighborhood and the ambiance of Piece.  They have all sort of novelty pizzas on the menu.   Also a very extensive beer selection.

Result: Wow.  Just wow.  Everything is incredible, including the duration of time it takes from the moment of entry to the moment of food or liquid touching your lips.  The demand here outstrips supply.  My proposal:  have a line spill out the door and spray everyone with icy cold water so only the worthy and determined can get inside.  If that doesn't work, maybe random electrocutions or rabid honey badgers should be considered.
