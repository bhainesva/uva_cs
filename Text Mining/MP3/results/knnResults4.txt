===========================

Result: This place is a locals favorite and a Houston institution. Well run and organized. Service is great and the chicken and waffles are not to be missed! Bring your wallet though, as it's a bit pricey.

Result: this place is the bees knees. the pulled pork and brisket are to die for and the sauce is drinkable. underrated part of the meal: their coleslaw. no one raves about coleslaw but theirs is the perfect twinge of tangy. only drawback is the location but if you have a car in the city -- this is a must do. don't expect any frills - this is down and dirty bbq at its finest.

Result: A staple for any trip to New Orleans. Oysters are as fresh as they come and HUGE. Went in for lunch, quick snack, and any other chance I got. Grab a seat at the bar to cut back on the line, order up a dozen with a cold beer, and enjoy.

Result: I enjoy almost all of their dishes...but let me be honest, I'm going there for the Sangria. Â The staff is hit or miss and it's very loud but almost always have a great time

Result: Having eaten in many NO spots, when you want to have oysters and beer, this is the place. Fresh Louisiana oysters....cold beer. Doesn't get much better. Do not waste time waiting for a table unless you are part of a group, since sitting at the bar and chatting with bartenders and shuckers is the true way to experience this place.
