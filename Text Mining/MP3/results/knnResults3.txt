Input Query: In the basement of United Nations building, this restaurant feels like an upscale izakaya. We sat in a middle booth. We ordered draft Sapporo ($7) which came with 2 inches of foam and in a less than a pint size glass. The service was fairly slow but not unbearable once we got our full bottle of unfiltered shirakawago sake. The bottle was set on the table on ice in a beautiful wooden container with flower. We ordered: Sashimi: Tuna, amberjack, mackerel, red snapper, and salmon with iruka (instead of the uni) b/c [my dinner mates are not adventurous eaters]. Each piece was spectacularly thick and supple. The roe on the salmon was best I have ever eaten. It was sweet with a touch of brine instead of the other way around. A+ for presentation. Tuna Tartare with yellow and black masago on a bed of thinly sliced cucumbers. Roasted Duck slices served cold and wrapped around a bundle of soy marinated Daikon topped with a dot of pea sauce and half moon lemon slices. This dish is about contrast. The fatty and chewy meat plays excellently against salty crispy radish and the finish of citrus just brightens the bite. Chawamushi: Steam Egg custard with mushroom in a sour chicken broth. It had similar flavor profile to Cantonese hot n sour soup. It is a bit more asian than rest of our food order. We had chicken two ways. First was the jidori shioyaki. Crispy chicken skin. Grilled served with salt and miso.  Second was the tori-karaage which a fancy term for fried chicken. Five almost too big pieces of poultry. I am not sure why lofan people always leave the vegetal side. The lettuce with the fried chicken was less decadent. Beef. We had the signature ishiyaki which was thinly sliced beef slices cooked on top of a hot stone. (See the video). We also had the steak which paled in comparison. Finally NOODLES. Inaniwa Udon served hot in a clear broth. It was so refreshing eating just noodles, broth, and spinach. The noodles were Al dente and very slurp-able. The broth was light and fresh but had firm flavor.  This is what you should order. Dessert. Black sesame creme br?l��e with black sesame ice cream.  Not so much burnt sugar but the Asian twist on this french dessert was rather delicious.
===========================

Result: I love this place. Have been here a few times. Not miss: chorizo-stuffed  dates, "deluxe" - taleggio cheese and truffle oil flatbread, braised pork shoulder when on the menu along with the couscous. Drinks are good, waiter/waitresses very helpful and friendly. Overall, a great meal out that is not too expensive!

Result: Hands down one of THE BEST lunch specials ever in the DTLA area. The $15 lunch special has been inflation-resistant for YEARS (quite an amazing thing if you think about it...) and you gotta love Sushi Gen for that. There's always a wait, but if you arrive early (i.e. 10:30am) you should be okay. It's definitely worth it.

Result: 'The tacos are making me thirsty...'  I believe Cosmo Kramer was referring to pretzels but at mercadito- it's the tacos. Some apps were good as was the bite of taco- but overall, it was quite oversalted.

Result: Great little brewery in the hip Wicker Park area. The beer was very good and the atmosphere was nice.  I loved the natural sunlight coming in through the skylights overhead.

Result: I love Cafe Iberico.  The goat cheese in tomato sauce is delish, and their sangria is the yardstick by which I measure all other sangrias.  I have loved everything I've had here (well...the blood sausages were a little weird).
