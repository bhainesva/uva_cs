Result: I love this place. But, I love it mid-Sunday afternoon when the brunch crowd has dispersed and the dinner crowd hasn't come in. Or, I love it on Thanksgiving night. Or, I love it at 2AM on a cold Saturday night. The staff is friendly - well, most of them - the food is good, and the drink selection is exciting. I love this place ... as does everyone else in the country. I'll always have my memories ...

Result: Yes I have been to Smoque BBQ. The wait in line is worth it! The food is fabulous. I love their baby back ribs BBQ sauce was so good I bought a bottle home. I also like their peach cobbler side and the owner is a cool friendly guy.

Result: Friendly service and wicked good BBQ.  It's a very small place so go early.  The brisket is the way to go.  Try the different sauces too.  And the peach cobbler was almost otherworldly good.
